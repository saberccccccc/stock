# Findings

- Registry, not historical discussion, defines the formal baseline as
  `ledger_path_v3_t0001_nolookahead`.
- Existing official CLIs cover Registry-driven replay, data-boundary audit,
  execution-coverage audit, scorecards, APM completeness, and Shadow replay.
- The baseline has both historical registrations and a later formal replay,
  so canonical evidence lineage must be resolved before another leaderboard.
- Historical ST execution coverage remains explicitly incomplete.
- The repository migration is complete locally, but remote durability still
  needs a no-force-push audit and recovery check.
